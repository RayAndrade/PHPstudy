I am a teacher and I am teaching how to use PHP with design patterns.
I need a  PHP  code example of the Behavioral Pattern , Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern.  Put each class in its own .php file.
I am using PHP 8.1
 Explain each class, method and variable in detail. Use Class names and viable names match those in the book “Design Patterns” by the gang of 4.
Use the index.php file to demo your code. Determine the order I would create each of the classes in your project. 
Order the creation of the class in a manor that dependency errors don’t appear while creating the project.
Add some humor to your response, create a funny situation.
What should I see when I run the code?
