**Week 2: Classes and Objects in Depth**

1. Class Constructors and Destructors
2. Visibility (public, protected, private)
3. Static properties and methods
4. The `this` keyword
5. Exercise: Build a simple class with properties, methods, and a constructor

**Week 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism**

1. Basics of inheritance
   - Extending classes
   - The `parent` keyword
2. Overriding methods

4. Magic methods (`__get`, `__set`, `__call`, etc.)
5. Exercise: Use traits and namespaces in a mini project

**Week 5: Handling Errors and Exceptions**

1. Error handling in PHP
2. Basics of exceptions
3. Creating custom exception classes
4. Try, Catch, Finally, and Throw
5. Exercise: Implement error and exception handling in an OOP project

**Week 6: Advanced PHP 7 Features for OOP**

1. Return type declarations
2. Nullable types
3. The `??` (null coalescing) operator

**Week 7: Design Patterns and Final Project**

1. Introduction to design patterns
   - Why design patterns?
   - Common design patterns in OOP (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer)
2. Project requirements release
3. In-class coding and guidance
4. Project presentations and feedback

Throughout the course, practical examples should be provided, and students should be encouraged to code along. The final project should consolidate the knowledge acquired over the previous six weeks and allow students to create a more complex, real-world application using OOP in PHP 7.

To supplement this course, you might consider incorporating reading materials, quizzes, peer reviews, and online resources. Collaboration is also key, so having students work in pairs or groups for certain assignments can be beneficial.
