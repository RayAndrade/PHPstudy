Hello, my name is Ray and I’m the ‘Ray’ in TheRayCode.

Welcome to the start of my video series in which I plan to create in a survey of the 23 design patterns as presented by the Gang of Four
 in their famous book Elements of Reusable  Object Oriented Software in the programming language PHP.

Please Subscribe so you won't miss any videos of the project.

If I present any code in my videos you will be able to find it posted at my GitHub site so you may play around with the code yourself 
The code should be heavily commented.

You can also find the code at my website TheRayCode.ORG
