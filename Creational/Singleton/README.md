Hello, I am Ray of TheRayCode.<br/>
In this video I plan to do a survey of the Design Pattern Singleton using PHP<br/>
I approach this pattern using other programming languages like Java, C# and C++<br/>
But is this video I will focus on PHP<br/>
I give you a list of reasons why a php developer should study this pattern<br/>
I take a look a the UML that the Gang Of Four presented in their book Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software<br/>
I give you a code example that you may play around with yourself<br/>
You can find the code posted at my Github and I also post the code at my website TheRayCode.ORG<br/>
and I close the video with a SWOT analysis of the pattern using PHP<br/>
I hope you enjoy<br/>
