Got it! You're looking for a **PHP** implementation of the **Factory** pattern, which is a **Creational** design pattern, following the exact naming conventions from the Gang of Four’s book.

## **Order of Class Creation**
To avoid dependency issues, we should create classes in this order:

1. **Product Interface (`Product.php`)** – This defines the contract for all concrete products.
2. **Concrete Product (`ConcreteProduct.php`)** – A class implementing the `Product` interface.
3. **Creator Interface (`Creator.php`)** – Defines the factory method.
4. **Concrete Creator (`ConcreteCreator.php`)** – Implements the factory method to return `ConcreteProduct` objects.
5. **Client (`Client.php`)** – Uses the factory to instantiate products.

Now, let's generate the PHP code with each class in a separate file.

### **Explanation of Classes and Methods**

1. **`Product` Interface (`Product.php`)**  
   - Defines a method `operation()` that must be implemented by concrete products.

2. **`ConcreteProduct` (`ConcreteProduct.php`)**  
   - Implements `Product` and provides a concrete `operation()` method.

3. **`Creator` Abstract Class (`Creator.php`)**  
   - Declares the abstract `factoryMethod()` that must be implemented by subclasses.
   - Defines `someOperation()`, which calls the `factoryMethod()` and uses the created product.

4. **`ConcreteCreator` (`ConcreteCreator.php`)**  
   - Implements `factoryMethod()` to return an instance of `ConcreteProduct`.

5. **`Client` (`Client.php`)**  
   - Instantiates `ConcreteCreator` and calls `someOperation()`.

This follows the Factory Method pattern from the **Gang of Four** while ensuring no dependency errors.
